#### [Lemonade Stand](http://kagreen.xyz/lemonade)

Lemonade Stand is a classic game used to teach children about business.

The game seems simple enough:

The player makes pitchers of lemonade out of lemons, sugar, and ice. They set the price at which to sell cups of lemonade to customers.

But it quickly gets more complex.

### Product design

Different lemonade recipes result in higher or lower customer satisfaction--but a better recipe is more expensive to make. Is it worth sacrificing customer opinion to produce a cheaper product?

### Pricing decisions

Price per cup will affect how many customers will decide to buy. If you have a great reputation for selling quality lemonade, you can get away with a higher price. But you need to build that reputation first.

### Marketing spend

Advertising can attract more customers, to help build your customer base faster. Or it can be a flop if the customers attracted by your advertising add their voice to your negative reviews.

### Inventory management

Lastly, players must manage inventory carefully. Lemons kept on hand too long may spoil. Any lemonade not sold at the end of the day goes down the drain--and the company's profits go along!
